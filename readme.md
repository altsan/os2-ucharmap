# Extended Character Map for OS/2

Extended Character Map for OS/2 (previously known as Double Byte Character
Map) is a character map program that is designed to support characters from
both single- and multi-byte encodings.  It supports both Unicode (Plane 0)
text, plus a number of specific East Asian codepages, in addition to the
current system codepage.

Conventional OS/2 character map programs support only single-byte characters,
which is generally sufficient for Western languages, but suddenly becomes
inadequate when you need access to the vast Unicode character set, or writing
systems like Chinese, Japanese, or Korean (collectively known as 'CJK').
Extended Character Map is designed to fill in this gap.

Extended Character Map does not require your system codepage(s) to be set to
any particular value.  It should be fully-functional on any language version
of OS/2.

The default makefile is for IBM C/C++ version 3.65.  To build, run 
`nmake32 NLV=xxx` where xxx is a three-digit country code for the national
language version to be built (defaults to 001).
